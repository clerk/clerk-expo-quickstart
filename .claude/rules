# Claude Code Rules for clerk-expo-quickstart

## Git Usage
- **NEVER** use git commands in any form
- User manages git themselves
- Do not commit, stash, check status, or perform any git operations

## Development Workflow
- Only use `pnpm start` for development server
- Use `npx expo prebuild` when native changes are needed
- Use `npx react-native run-ios` for iOS builds
